I'm a  young french engineer graduated from the school of ISEP in Paris. I've have work during a year and half in a consulting company, as a Data Scientist, where I mostly worked on NLP subjects. I'm following right now a MSc in CentraleSupÃ©lÃ©c in Artificial Intelligence which will end in December 2020. I will start in July an internship at Thales to work on reinforcement learning on a very cool project !

Passionate about IA, I enjoy experimentating and find new fun projects. I'm particulatly interested in the domain of reinforcement learning or computer vision. 

This page is a short portfolio to all the projects I've completed so far. So far, it's not exhaustive, so this will be updated frequently as I advance in my journey in the beautiful field that is AI ðŸ˜„ !
