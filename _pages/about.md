I'm a french engineer from Paris, passionate about IA, and I enjoy experimenting and find new fun projects.
I've have work during a year and half in a consulting company as a Data Scientist, where I worked mostly on NLP.
I'm finishing a MSc at CentraleSup√©lec in Artificial Intelligence which will end in 2020 and currently, I am working at Thales as a Research Engineer.
My work is focus on the state-of-the-art methods in Reinforcement Learning, and I am particularly interested in the use of communication network in multi-agent system.
This blog contains a short portfolio for some of the cool projects I worked on in the last years, as well as articles on subjects I wanted to talk about.

## UPDATE DECEMBER 2020 :
I'm looking for a position as a Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer / Research Engineer in Deep Learning starting in January 2021.
Don't hesitate to contact me if you are interested by my profile.
