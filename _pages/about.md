I am a french engineer from Paris, passionate about IA. I will try to post on this website all the cool projects I have been part of,
and share some blog post on interesting topics in AI.
I am mostly interested by the field of reinforcement learning, but I have also worked on NLP and Computer Vision projects.
You can find my resume[here](https://antoninduval.github.io/files/CV_Antonin_DUVAL_2020_EN.pdf) !

## UPDATE DECEMBER 2020 :
I'm looking for a position as a Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer / Research Engineer in Deep Learning starting in January 2021.
Feel free to contact me if you are interested by my profile.
