I'm a french engineer from Paris, passionate about IA, and I enjoy experimentating and find new fun projects. I've have work during a year and half in a consulting company, as a Data Scientist, where I worked on NLP projects. I'm finishing a MSc at CentraleSupéléc in Artificial Intelligence which will end in 2020 and currently, I'm doing my internship at Thales as a Research Engineer. I am working on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, and I am particularly interested in the use of communication network to improve learning and cooperation between agents.


This blog is a short portfolio for the cool projects I worked on in the last few years, as well as some blog post on subjects I like to talk about.
