I am working on Multi-Agent Reinforcement LearnDecember 2020. I will start in July an internship at Thales to work on reinforcement learning on a very cool project !

Passionate about IA, I enjoy experimentating, and I afind new fun projects. I'm particulartly interested in the use of communication network to improve learning and cooperation between agents.
