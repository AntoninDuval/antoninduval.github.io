This project presents the making of an Artificial Intelligence to play the Vampire VS Werewolves game.
This game opposes as its name implies, werewolves versus vampire, the winning side being the most numerous one at the end.
The teams starts with the same number of units. In order to win the game, each team can turn humans into their side or
kill some opponents following some specific rules. To be able to create a proper AI and not a random player nor a reflex agent,
a global strategy had to be established first, which should take into account the opponents moves.

We propose a simple, yet efficient method using the A* algorithm alongside several features such as vision field or multi-processing
to speed up the search and explore the maximum depth.
